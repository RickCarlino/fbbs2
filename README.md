# Forth BBS 2 (1985)

A reconstruction of a historic Forth BBS system.
Not much else is known about it at this time. File timestamps and log comments seem to hint that the BBS was used around 1985 and ran on DOS (which DOS?).

## Goals

 * Get it to run on modern hardware, an emulator or restored hardware that is period correct
 * Document its history
 * Get it online so that it can be used again by enthusiasts (probably via TCP or WebSocket proxy since I don't have a phone line)

## Directory Contents

 * `pristine/` Unchanged source code for historic preservation purposes.
 * `modern/` Work in progress. A modernized version of the source code that someday will run on modern systems or emulators. We're not sure yet.

The soon-to-be-working source code can be found in `pristine/FBBS2.fth`

## Run / Build Instructions

Unknown at this time

## Resources

I will add more resources about this package as I find them.
