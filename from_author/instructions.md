A lot of the history is in the messages in the last FBBS file.
The date code is pre 2k, so needs updating.
The fbbs45.dat file has a new entry from yesterday using a new command I (Tom) added: add-dated - make entry with date as name.
Turns out the F-PC.exe I sent you requires the block code to load the FBBS.
all you have to do to is specify the fbbs dictionary and 'use' the .dat file: `fbbs use fbbs45.dat`
The OS on Z80's was CPM.
