A note to F83 users from John Peters                 119MAY85JAPDear F83 BBS interested person,                     May 15, 1985                                                                   I have gone thru the various disks and versions I have in thelibrary.  The files on this disk are the best of all.  The BBS  was originally obtained by me from Jeff Wilson in the form of a MVP Forth disk.  I sent a copy of version 0.0 to Tom Belpasso   who modified it for F83 and added Virtual I/O so that the data  can be in a separate file.  There is a working version on the   disk called FBBS1.COM.  It works fine with FBBS2.DAT.  However  later Jeff sent me version 2.0 of FBBS.  The COM file I have    for that version? gives me a "bad load".  That is why I have    included a copy of FBBS1.COM as it is the only working version Ihave.  This is on top of the old F83 1.0.0, doen not contain anyof my developement tools and requires you to reset VBLK to zero as it was originally set to 40.        JP                       A HAND WRITTEN NOTE ENCLOSED WITH THE DISK from Tom.  15MAY85JAPHi John,                                            Jan 12, 1985   Here is the FBBS stuff. Pack dosen't work.

Tom Belpasso                      LETTER TO TOM BELPASSO                                15MAY85JAPDear Tom,                                           May 15, 1985                                                                   I am uploading what I have in the library to CL BBS as a     Library so it is not dependant on you to fix what ails it.      I do want you to have the latest information on it.               When I compile the file FBBS2.BLK on to F83 2.1.2 it has      problems.  I think it might be in the area of Virtual file I/O. Currently I have tried both the VIO in the file FBBS2.BLK and   the V-I/0 from EZDIR.BLK which I have in a seprate file.^
