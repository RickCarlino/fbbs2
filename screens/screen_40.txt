FORTH Bulitin Board System (FBBS)         15JAN85JAP  15MAY85JAP
I can't get it to compile of F83 2.1.2  (See FBBS1.COM it works)
                                                                
Screen 2 is ideas, 3 is patches to F83 to match M.V.P. Forth.   
4-25 is code for basic BBS  26-36 file handling stuff(untested) 
Data in the tree is now in a separate file.  You can run FBBS2  
.COM from your keyboard.  Screen 31 must be modified for your   
system. To allow for a larger BBS, change construct VBLK to 0   
and use a new file.  The BBS is in a seperate vocabulary, FBBS. 
   To begin the BBS type:                                       
         FBBS   0 IS VBLK   and  START or SAFER                 
SAFER allows only BBS commands, and protects the system from the
user.  Type TPEE to return to FORTH.  Type READ BBS to start.   
READ HELP or READ COMMANDS are good too.
