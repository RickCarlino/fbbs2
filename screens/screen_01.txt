To begin the BBS type:   INIT-BBS which is the same as below.   
  OPEN FBBS2.DAT    FBBS   0 IS VBLK   and  START or SAFER      
Safer allows only BBS commands, and protects the system from the
user.  Type TPEE to return to Forth.  Type READ BBS to start at 
the trunk of the tree.  READ HELP or READ COMMANDS are good too.

   When I compile FBBS2.BLK and start it FIND-NAME never does!, 
however there is a working version called FBBS1.COM on this disk
that runs on top of F83 1.0.0
