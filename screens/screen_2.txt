 1) The first block of the virtual memory is the value of  the  
    constant VBLK.  Default value is 40 to allow both the source
    and BBS to reside in the same file to facilitate debuging.  
    You can dedicate a seperate file for the BBS messages by    
    changing the value of VBLK to 0.  I added a double precision
    constant VOFF to allow greater flexablity for the virtual   
    memory support.                                             
 2) K? is now case and control key insensitive, ie. upper, lower
    or control K will kill the message.  The same for S to pause
 3) Pack, import and export are untested and not loaded with OK.
